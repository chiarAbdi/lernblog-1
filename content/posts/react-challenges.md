## 1- React: Create a Simple JSX Element

#### Instructions:

The current code uses **JSX** to assign a div element to the constant JSX. Replace the div with an h1 element and add the text Hello JSX! inside it.

## 2-React: Create a Complex JSX Element

### Instructions:

Define a new constant JSX that renders a div which contains the following elements in order:

An h1, a p, and an unordered list that contains three li items. You can include any text you want within each element.

Note: When rendering multiple elements like this, you can wrap them all in parentheses, but it's not strictly required. Also notice this challenge uses a div tag to wrap all the child elements within a single parent element. If you remove the div, the JSX will no longer transpile. Keep this in mind, since it will also apply when you return JSX elements in React components.

* The constant JSX should return a div element.
* The div should contain a p tag as the second element.
* The div should contain a ul tag as the third element.
* The div should contain an h1 tag as the first element.
* The ul should contain three li elements.

## 3- React: Add Comments in JSX

JSX is a syntax that gets compiled into valid JavaScript. Sometimes, for readability, you might need to add comments to your code. Like most programming languages, JSX has its own way to do this.

To put comments inside JSX, you use the syntax {/\* \*/}to wrap around the comment text.

The code editor has a JSX element similar to what you created in the last challenge. Add a comment somewhere within the provided divelement, without modifying the existing h1or pelements.

### Instructions:

* The constant JSXshould return a divelement.
* The divshould contain an h1tag as the first element.
* The divshould contain a ptag as the second element.
* The JSXshould include a comment.
