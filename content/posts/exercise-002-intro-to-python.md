description = "Subset and conquer\nSubsetting Python lists is a piece of cake. Take the code sample below, which creates a list x and then selects \"b\" from it. Remember that this is the second element, so it has index 1. You can also use negative indexing.\n\n  x = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"]\n  x[1]\n  x[-3] # same result!\n\nRemember the areas list from before, containing both strings and floats? Its definition is already in the script. Can you add the correct code to do some Python subsetting?"

## Instructions

* Print out the second element from the areas list (it has the value 11.25).
* Subset and print out the last element of areas, being 9.50. Using a negative index makes sense here!
* Select the number representing the area of the living room (20.0) and print it out

## Task

# the **areas list**

**areas** = \["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]

1. Print out second element from areas
2. Print out last element from areas
3. Print out the area of the living room
