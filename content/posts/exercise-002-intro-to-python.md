description = "Subset and conquer\nSubsetting Python lists is a piece of cake. Take the code sample below, which creates a list x and then selects \"b\" from it. Remember that this is the second element, so it has index 1. You can also use negative indexing.\n\nx = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"]\nx[1]\nx[-3] # same result!\n\nRemember the areas list from before, containing both strings and floats? Its definition is already in the script. Can you add the correct code to do some Python subsetting?"

## Instructions

> Print out the second element from the areas list (it has the value 11.25).
>
> Subset and print out the last element of areas, being 9.50. Using a negative index makes sense here!
>
> Select the number representing the area of the living room (20.0) and print it out
